CARD DND CAMPAIGN PLANS

SETTING
About a century after Koorek's ascension to become a lesser deity, the world's continents have been endangered
by rising sea levels and brutal storms due to the Ripper, a moon that has long had a low orbit, but now has gotten
within mere miles of land. Whether by wrath of Selune the Moon Goddess or by whim of Talos the Storm Lord, the tides
have become a thing to be feared, and the oceans a dauting path to travel.
	- Corellon, the High Elvish city-island, survives through sheer force of meteorological wizardry
	- Volkan vo Moradin, the tunnels beneath, and the gnomish isles, of course, have been largely unaffected.
	- Many wood-elvish, orcish, and beastfolk settlements have been wiped out

INTRO
A ship of ~400 people came from Corellon to the long-unexplored and dangerous land of Jolyu in search of Storm
Crystals -- magical crystals that the aforementioned elvish wizards are consuming to keep the city afloat.

- manned by Parken and one other storm sorcerer to ensure safety of passage
- shipwrecked (by what?)

First major arc should be cetered around keeping the shipwrecked elves and the elves of Corellon safe.
